-- Consider the following table structure for a store's inventory:
-- CREATE TABLE inventory (
--  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
--  name VARCHAR(255),
--  quantity INT,
--  price DECIMAL(10,2),
--  category VARCHAR(50)
-- );
-- Write a query to retrieve the name and price of all items in the 
-- inventory where the quantity is greater than 0 and the category 
-- is 'electronics', sorted in descending order by price.

create database practice3_1_2;
use practice3_1_2;
